# Flappy Bird

My version of the Flappy Bird game based on [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/103KUA/)

## How to play

### Local

  After cloning the repo you can start the game with `npm start` and the game will be available on http://localhost:8080/

### Deployed

  https://gpavlov951.github.io/flappy-bird-udemy-course/game/

## Score

The best score is saved in the local storage and you can check it in the scene "Score" and also is visible when you playing the game.

# Enjoy it ;)
